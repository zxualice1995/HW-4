We have tried both lesson 1 and 14 in class, and it doesn't seem to be too complicated becuase there was an example of the 
code in Arduino already and we followed the given instructions. Everything happened so fast, and I only knew what I had to do
becuase I was told to do it. After the readings, I got a better understanding of the more detailed instructions and how the
code work. In the new lesson 2, I learned about the resistor and how it could control the brightness of an LED. The way the
resistor control the the flow of electricity is based on the different type of the resistor. Then bring up my question of 
is there restrains on the limit of electricities, like how you could only turn 180 degrees of the motor. And also what is GND?
